# Discord-Dynamic-Nickname
A simple nickname dynamic async changer made for Discord guilds in C# with the Anarchy library.

Enjoy! I decided to make this little GUI tool to modify automatically your nickname in every Discord guild. Everything you need is your Discord user token, the ID of the guild and the dynamic nickname you want to apply. You can decide to start and stop the looping everytime you want. I decided to make this because some servers are making these beautiful tools containing token grabbers, so I decided to remake this tool free and open source for everybody so you can understaand how it works.

# Example of dynamic nickname
If you put "Hello!", your nickname every 750 milliseconds will change like that:
- H
- He
- Hel
- Hell
- Hello
- Hello!
And again it will become "H" and the loop will continue.
